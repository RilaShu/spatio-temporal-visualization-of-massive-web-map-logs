# Navigation #

The Aperture Tiles user interface works much like a modern web-based map system. Your source data is projected on a set of tiles in an x/y cross-plot or a geographic map. In either case, your data is aggregated at several zoom levels so you can view the data at a high level or drill down to see more detailed distribution.

## Zoom ##

<h6 class="procedure">To zoom in on an area you want to investigate</h6>

- Double click on the region, OR 
- Click the **Zoom In** ![Zoom In](../../../img/zoom-in.png) button in the upper right corner of the map.

<h6 class="procedure">To zoom out</h6>

- Click the **Zoom Out** ![Zoom Out](../../../img/zoom-out.png) button in the upper right corner of the map, OR
- Use the scroll button on your mouse to quickly zoom in or out

### Zoom to City ###

<h6 class="procedure">To quickly zoom to a major city in South America</h6>

1. Click the **Description** control in the upper right corner of the map.

    <img src="../../../img/description.png" class="screenshot" alt="Description" />

2. Select the appropriate city from the **Zoom to City** drop-down list in the project description.

    <img src="../../../img/zoom-to-city.png" class="screenshot" alt="Zoom to City" />

The map is redrawn to show the selected city with a zoom factor of five.

**NOTE**: This is customized control that requires specialized code not available in the standard Aperture Tiles template or base libraries.

## Explore ##

<h6 class="procedure">To view other areas of the map</h6>

- Click and drag in the direction you want to move. You can overscroll from the left side of the map to the right and vice versa.
